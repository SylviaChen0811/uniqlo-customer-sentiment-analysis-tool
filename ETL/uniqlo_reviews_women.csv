Ordered in both S and M, as I seem to be sitting between sizes these days.  My usual size elsewhere is a P8-10/PM, but I tend to size down in UQ’s often extravagantly sized outerwear.  In this particular style, however, I find the S does not allow enough room for thicker layering.  The fit across the bust, upper back, and hip is exact when zipped up.  So, I will be keeping the M, which is expectedly very roomy but happily still maintains its clean A.line structure when worn.  At 5’2”, the hem does fall lower on me, like a short coat length.  And the sleeves are a little bit long, but still fine without hemming.  I must say I find the actual fit/look of this parka to be much smarter and flattering than the baggy shapes shown on the models.  Perhaps, they are in the wrong size?  Anyhow, I recommend going with your usual outerwear size to enable easy layering and easy movement.  Overall, quality is good per UQ standard.  The cotton blend is nice.  The construction is nice.  I especially appreciate the double closure of zipper and snaps.  I think this will make the jacket more wearable and comfortable in varying climate/weather.  I took off one star, as I think there is real room for improvement in the garment design here.

68179,E445172-000,23327,4,3,"This is a good lightweight jacket for milder weather.  I am so happy to see UQ finally put out a chore style jacket with a much more classic cut/fit than recent previous renditions (was not a fan of the awkward menswear/bomber style proportions).  This version has a  straight/slight A.line silhouette in the body that makes it easy, flattering, and versatile.  The hem flows over the hips easily and smoothly.  The shoulders are dropped and roomy, but not excessively so.  The sleeves are wide, but not excessively so.  Overall fit is relaxed, but again not excessively so.  My usual size being a PM/P8-10 but carrying extra covid+holiday gains, I found myself between sizes S and M.  Both sizes actually fit fairly well, and at quick glance do not look all that different.  The main difference is the S offers a more shrunken (cropped) but still relaxed look, while the M offers just a little more width and length and also shoulder space.  The S would be excellent and neat over dresses and skirts with lightweight woven tops, while the M would be better if layering over knitwear and heavier tops.  At 5’2”, I did find the sleeves slightly long.  I will probably have them shortened 1.5 inches.  So, I would say overall the jacket runs true to size for a relaxed fit.  Depending on your fit preference/outfitting intention, I would suggest taking normal size or trying one size down.  The yellow color is pleasant, true to pictured.  I took off one star because I found the fabric, though very decent, not as polished or luxe as recent previous (ill-fitting) versions.  Nevertheless, the finishing details here are all very nice.  This is an attractive and useful jacket.  I would love to see more colors and other fabrications in this same cut/fit/design!  Thank you UQ!

164158,E442732-000,23327,5,3,"This is the second of these I own. I just got the beautiful ""red"" which is in fact a hard to describe deep dusty rose, a very beautiful and easy to wear color. My first one is black, and I've worn that one almost every winter day for the last 3 years. I bought one for a best friend (we are both usually ""SMALL"" but I got us MEDIUM to wear bulky winter clothes underneath, the online size chart also recommended I get the medium.) We both wear these more than any other piece of cool weather gear we own. Inside they are ""down sweaters"", the perfect chill-chaser. Outside they are the perfect uber-packable warm jacket, an indispensable travel piece. My favorite feature is two very large internal pockets, large enough to carry an extra hat, a flask, a place to keep a map dry — in addition to two large zipped exterior pockets. No other manufacturer has thought to include this ability to carry large items and keep them clean and dry next to your body, making this jacket my favorite piece of trekking/hiking/city walking gear of all time. I also wanted to note something I saw in another review, where they ""washed this once and all the down bunched up"". I've washed mine many many times, you need to dry the coat on low/no heat with clean tennis balls or sneakers so the down is fluffed as it dries. This is true for any down coat/sleeping bag/etc. FYI, this coat has never leaked down, I can wear a black t-shirt beneath and there's no fluff on it. I also saw a few comments about the ""cheap thin fabric"" which I want to say is so far from the truth. The coat has a luxurious silky feel, smooth but not cheaply shiny, and so lightweight it packs in the space of extra socks, and as I mentioned, has lasted me for years of heavy wear both indoors and out. The price for this quality makes it an incredible bargain. My friend also bought the very light pink one, it's also gorgeous. I also love the cut, the collar adds lots of warmth for colder days, and I am so glad there is no hood — you can layer it beneath a raincoat for that snow-to-rain day, and personally I always prefer a hat for better visibility. In short, there is nothing about this coat that isn't perfect.

It’s comfortable, easy to get on & off, doesn’t feel too heavy while wearing, & the natural color goes well with so many other colors. I live in the South, where we don’t tend to have harsh winters, so I think I’ll get a lot of use out of this through the fall & winter.

I wish Uniqlo would offer this shirt also in a soft, neutral (not yellow-based) off- white; that pure blinding white color currently offered is good, but harsh on some people. I purchased the blue. Although I've decided to keep it, for lack of something better at the moment, it is not a pretty color. It's such a pale shade, with a grey overtone, and not flattering. As for the rest of the colors, I sometimes wonder how/why Uniqlo comes up with them. It's disappointing how unflattering they are on everybody! This is largely true throughout their site, in my opinion--a lot of muddy or very off colors. Uniqlo, are you listening? The other thing I'm not crazy about on this shirt is the collar/opening and the positioning of the buttons; I feel as if the neck opening is too small (even though it isn't and I have a normal size neck circumference) and that, perhaps, the collar is a bit too short as it seems to sit too far back when the shirt is not buttoned all the way up to the top.

It is a paler, more peachy tone, whereas I was expecting something rather bright orangey from the photos (both on my monitor and phone so I know it wasn't a screen calibration issue).

They have a more conventional fabric for the hood lining which I appreciate so much since heavier fabrics tend to get itchy on my face/hair.

268034,E425974-000,23332,2,4,"There are two big problems I have with these shirts which make them irredeemable. 

The first one is that the fabric is a stretchy nylon material which I wasn't expecting as I ordered it online and it looks like regular cotton in the photo's. I dislike this fabric. It feels cheap and is way too shiny. Overtime the sheen as gone away but it's not comfortable to wear. Feels slippery and scratchy against the skin. Not a fan. This shirt would have been so much better if they just made it out of normal cotton. The fabric choice makes it look cheap. But hey they're inexpensive shirts and that's what you get. 

The second issue I have is that the collar is way too tight and it makes the shirt look awkward because it is meant to be oversized. And I'm a skinny guy with a slim neck. An oversized shirt should not have a tight fitting collar it should be slightly loose. This tight collar has an unflattering appearance on such a big shirt and you can't even stretch it out because the nylon material won't give. That would really just be a band aid anyway. I shouldn't have to stretch the collar out so it fits bigger on OVERSIZED shirt.

It's disappointing because otherwise these shirts would have been great. Unless you're into these aspects that I view as flaws I suggest you look somewhere else for slouchy t-shirts.",Not a fan.,4.5,529,3.44,12,11,12,61,433,"5'8"" - 5'9""",,,M,6,25 to 34 years,Male,California,Downing,1606863088,True,False,False

I ordered a large in this oversized t shirt and it fits great. I would not recommend you size up or down if you know your size in regular Uniqlo t shirts. Obviously, the sleeves are mean to be long and end right before or around the elbow. They do fit loose around the chest and hips, but that's to be expected. They aren't much longer than regular uniqlo t shirts, if at all.

The amazing thing about this shirt is the material. I've never owned a t shirt with this material. The fabric is somewhat thick, much thicker than a normal uniqlo cotton t shirt, but it's somehow cooler to wear. It's really amazing especially for these warmer days. I've tried cotton and polyester mixed shirts before but none like this. You really have to try it on and feel it for yourself. It's got the best qualities of both cotton and polyester without the drawbacks. It doesn't shrink and wrinkle like cotton, but it isn't staticky and flimsy like polyester. It's soft to the skin like cotton, while cool and smooth like polyester.

I ordered XL since I didn't want to add bulk under clothing.

How smart are people who developed this product- knowing there is Lycra inside they calculated the shrinkage after first wash-and-dry, so your size to be intact for long-term usage after first laundry. Beside all superlatives I would repeat again after buying this second batch of t-shirts, I would like to make a suggestion to the team, working on the product ( and I KNOW they read every review and listen!). Because this is a seasonal garment, more suitable for cold weather, I would ask to don’t grade the length down size Medium.  First, it is nice to have warmth in the back in winter and second- the Lycra inside and the ingenious shoulder gives you a chance to buy 1-2 sizes smaller- for very sexy look, and having the length graded with an inch- it is a problem. I am absolutely in love with this t-shirt, it keeps shape after wash/dry, very soft, very warm, made with upmost precision by master-seamstresses in Vietnam.

The actual review: 
Okay, I have had this fleece Heattech before and it's great. It's soft on the OUTSIDE and smooth on the INSIDE. I am 5'3"" and around 112lbs. I ordered a x-small and I own another (crewneck) in small. In my opinion, the XS is good if you want a more form-fitting turtleneck for layering. The neck is a little slim IMO, so I stretched it just a bit since I prefer a looser neck. Also, the length falls right above the hip for me (and if I don't have it tucked in, if I raise my arms above my head my navel will be exposed.) The sleeves hit exactly at the wrist.

Since working out in gyms especially nowadays is tricky, I opt for the outdoors. My area has all four seasons so I’m a fan of all their base layers tops. Currently the weather here is between 30’s-50’s. 

Background info: I’m vertically-challenged at 5’0” tall, a size 2 or 4 in lulu’s and an xs or sm in the swoosh brand - both for running activewear depending on the cut and/or material.

I ordered a small and this lovely neutral shaded fleece turtleneck has a relaxed fit on me which is fine. The size xs would’ve been good too but the slightly baggy feel during my runs/walks is preferred. 

The sleeves are long too but I like that to keep my hands warm during my workout. The neck area is not structured so it feels comfortable and warm. I usually pair this with the ultra light down vest or a fleece vest. That combo does the job.

The shirt feels and looks like a quality basic. It’s thicker than others I’ve tried and it’s not see through at all. Because of the quality, it can easily be dressed up a little or worn with a blazer for work, and for the price, you can’t really go wrong. I do recommend reading size chart measurements.

This worried me as I usually wear a size 4 pant or skirt or so in other retailers, but I went with the guide. It fits well, but has a tendency to hit more at my hip than my waist, but I figured it was better to size up vs down. (and I didn't want to purchase a skirt based on my instinctual 'suck in my gut' waist size!)

The skirt goes almost to my ankles, and the blue is beautiful. The pleats held up after one wash. The fabric is thin, so you may want to wear a slip or some sort. It does make me feel carefree and fancy!

It seemed a bit big, but I figured I only had one shot to buy this hot item - I'm normally a 4 or so in J. Crew sizes, for example. I expected it to sit at the narrow of my waist, like in the picture, but it sits more at the top of my hips. I'm 5'6"" and it's essentially ankle length as a result - this is one long skirt. But I guess it's better to have a slightly bigger waist than a slightly smaller one, as this skirt has a button and zip close and no elastic. That close makes it feel high class. 4 stars, as it may run a little big, but I have no other uniqlo bottoms to compare it to, as I don't have a store near me.

Also, if you do carry some extra weight in your waistline, then the fit on these may be uncomfortable since, as I mentioned, the waist doesn’t gape, it follows the hip to waist curve.

Wearing this, you would definitely be knocking things over in a small shop as well as mopping up dust/dirt/grime when weaving through stalls at the farmers market or getting in/out of closely parked cars.  Aesthetically, it is also not flattering.  There is so much untamable bulk due to the design and fabric.  I think one would need to be very tall and larger framed and perhaps also rely on some serious styling tricks (belting, cuffing, flattening under a coat) to not appear dwarfed in this dress.  I ordered a size down, but still found the volume impossible.  The sleeves are also very long.  And the gathered/ruched design leaves a rumpled mess of fabric sitting atop the chest.

Since I already own 2 Thinx pants that I had purchased a while back, I was already familiar with the concept of period pants. With Thinx, I often leaked on the sides through the stiches, so I actually barely used them. 
I was a bit skeptical trying out the UNIQLO product because of that past experience, but also because the waist band seemed to be suspiciously tight. But once worn, it didn't bother me really.
I wore it on my second day of my period, so still had a quite strong flow. I wore it for a good 5-6 hours, and although you could tell it was soaking up and felt a little cool to the touch, it didn't leak at all and really didn't feel the slightest discomfort!! I think the fact that they used glue instead stitching the seams made a big difference for it NOT to leak! 
So impressed!! 
To compare, I used my Thinx on the next day of my period. Since the flow was already rather weak, they didn't leak either, but it felt less dry and I felt a stronger urge of wanting to change my panties. 
The washing was a bit tedious. Since the fabric is black all the way, it's really hard to tell how much longer you need to rinse out the blood. (but same thing with my Thinx underwear). I followed the instructions and washed them in the washing machine after in a cold cycle. Because of the AIRism fabric, I noticed that the pants dried super quickly vs the Thinx that took way longer time to dry since they were made of cotton.

I washed item first before wearing it but it's bit hard to dry completely even used dryer for it alone. And when I'm wearing it, still feel like not completely dry which made me uncomfortable.

I ended up with changing it about half day as I wear it at my 4th day which is not that much. But after I weard it, also bit confused how should I wash it. Can I wash it by washer with other item or I should wash alone? I did handwash again but as pad is black, very hard to find out if it is already clean or not.

The only issue is that the straps are somewhat uncomfortable because they are a different material and have the seam inside on the chest, so if your bra isn't flush underneath the straps or you go braless, it might be irritating after a while.

While Uniqlo allegedly tried to improve their second generation masks, the effort has failed. The material is thinner/lighter which can be be a pro, but the quality control is worse with stray threads hanging about. The masks are also noticeably bigger for the same size compared to the original sizing. But the BIGGEST issue is that the ear loops are TIGHTER, more stressful on the ears, and significantly more comfortable with exposed elastic and Uniqlo not disclosing they removed the cushioning cotton that made the first version so good. This renders the mask almost USELESS if it is uncomfortable to wear and keep on the face. Uniqlo fails to disclose this change and actually markets it as the opposite of what it is - a clear cost cutting measure. They will not offer any demo products and the packaging is opaque so you can’t even tell there is this issue until you open the packaging.

The other thing that works against this mask is it's knit, which isn't nearly as effective as a tightly woven cotton or silk. SO I cut a flat piece of tight and light cotton and pressed onto its back a matching piece of medium-weight fabric interfacing. Along the inside nose edge of the Airism mask, I sewed a 3/8"" (1 cm) open-ended tube centered and about 1/4"" (7mm) from the nose so that I could insert a piece of bendable aluminum (about 3"" or 7-1/2 cm long) for a custom, tight fit at the nose. Then I zig-zagged the new, lined cotton layer to the top of the Airism mask along all 4 edges, starting from near the ear.

Final recommendation: DO NOT BUY

Main reason for a bad review is the sizes stink - I bought all 3 sizes, every size was too lose or too small for my kids (@ 10), my wife, and myself.

What I like: 
The material of the mask is good, the ear loops are a comfortable material, and it is easy to care for & breath through

What Uniqlo can improve on: 
1) make them adjustable
2) make a neck loop so I can quickly take off / on the mask and it sits back. The neck loops you can buy arent great, so having it built in is better
3) nose wire. Seriously this is a requirement, I assumed this had it. My mistake. But bigger mistake they didn't include one
4) the mask fit isn't great. Other masks really form to my face better, I can't describe it, but I didn't like wearing this when I just put it on my face tighter as if they built it properly.

Before the mask came out in the US, I read reviews about how the mask was thick and difficult to breath in, but I saw that they improved the material so I wanted to give it a try.

Sadly, for me, wearing this mask is difficult to breath with and after a short walk I found myself panting. It also fogged my glasses. However, I should also mention that this could be because I have a small face (I am a small petite woman) and I ordered a medium because I saw that small was for children. When I breathe in, the area around the mask near my mouth also comes in so there's the feeling of blowing in a balloon (which is why I think it is difficult for me to breath with mask). The effects of this mask may be different if it fits tight and snug on your face.

Overall, the construction of the mask is good, and the material feels like airism.

I love Airism and I thought Uniqlo of all companies would be able to make a breathable mask because of their experience with their Airism products. Unfortunately it failed to deliver. Still, I think just a few tweaks would make this so much better, I hope Uniqlo is taking notice.
PROS: It looks great. My son (9) loved his black mask and said it made him look like a ninja. He said it was comfortable. The masks look well made and stylish and the fabric feels great.
CONS: The sizing is waaay off. I read all the reviews and went up a size and even so what we bought was too small. I bought size Small for my 9 year old and it was just barely too small, pulled on the ears. I bought Medium for myself (Asian woman, flat bridge, average face, wears glasses) and it was too small. It was also too shallow so it slid down my nose when I talked, and since it was cut so close to my face, every time I breathed in and out it would stick to my nostrils. It lacks a nose wire so my glasses fogged up. Lastly, and this is a big problem, you can't easily tell which way is up or down, OR which way is inside or out (there is a very small logo on the outside, hard to see). This means if you take off the mask you can accidentally put the dirty OUTER side inside, next to nose and mouth.

The mask is three layered, fits perfectly on the face with good seal for safety. It is comfortable on the ears, nose and chin. If you tuck the top part on the bridge of your nose under your glasses, there is no fogging! This is rare with other masks. 
I wear it for long walks (10 mi). My face stays cool. There is no sweat on my face under the mask.

First, I was really surprised that the mask lacked any kind of wire for molding the nose bridge.

Second, I was surprised that the ear loops were too large and not very stretchy, so the mask hung quite loosely off my face. I could have ordered a smaller size, but wanted a longer length so it wouldn't constantly pull down.

It's actually more breathable to wear it inside out, i.e., with the logo facing in rather than out.

It is very breathable, and I was not uncomfortable after wearing it for a couple of hours. The fabric is very soft and the mask overall is VERY lightweight. I am a girl and both the medium and large fit me. The medium was a snug fit while the large felt like it was just resting on my face (It did not slip or fall). I would say men should definitely buy the large. 

This mask is not super different compared to a regular cloth mask or a surgical mask, but it's clear advantage is it's moisture wicking and deodorizing properties. This mask did not smell at all after hours of wear and, while you will still feel the hotness of your breath, the fabric did not seem to soak up any moisture. I do like that the mask has a lot of coverage, covering up to past my eyes when looked at from the side (going towards my ear). This mask will probably be fine for light exercise, but if you are doing an intense workout, you should probably get a mask made for that (Though those can get pricey). There is a supposedly a filter in the middle and it has three layers. The outer layer is not waterproof, but the mask does not absorb water easily (I ran water on it in my sink). 

My breathe did not go through it while breathing, so I think this mask is more than adequate for basic coronavirus prevention and protection. Keep in mind this mask is NOT medical grade. My one complaint for this mask is that the earloops are not stretchy AT ALL. You really need to buy your perfect fit. I find that a small bit of stretch usually helps getting a snugger fit.

164158,E442732-000,23363,5,3,"This is the second of these I own. I just got the beautiful ""red"" which is in fact a hard to describe deep dusty rose, a very beautiful and easy to wear color. My first one is black, and I've worn that one almost every winter day for the last 3 years. I bought one for a best friend (we are both usually ""SMALL"" but I got us MEDIUM to wear bulky winter clothes underneath, the online size chart also recommended I get the medium.) We both wear these more than any other piece of cool weather gear we own. Inside they are ""down sweaters"", the perfect chill-chaser. Outside they are the perfect uber-packable warm jacket, an indispensable travel piece. My favorite feature is two very large internal pockets, large enough to carry an extra hat, a flask, a place to keep a map dry — in addition to two large zipped exterior pockets. No other manufacturer has thought to include this ability to carry large items and keep them clean and dry next to your body, making this jacket my favorite piece of trekking/hiking/city walking gear of all time. I also wanted to note something I saw in another review, where they ""washed this once and all the down bunched up"". I've washed mine many many times, you need to dry the coat on low/no heat with clean tennis balls or sneakers so the down is fluffed as it dries. This is true for any down coat/sleeping bag/etc. FYI, this coat has never leaked down, I can wear a black t-shirt beneath and there's no fluff on it. I also saw a few comments about the ""cheap thin fabric"" which I want to say is so far from the truth. The coat has a luxurious silky feel, smooth but not cheaply shiny, and so lightweight it packs in the space of extra socks, and as I mentioned, has lasted me for years of heavy wear both indoors and out. The price for this quality makes it an incredible bargain. My friend also bought the very light pink one, it's also gorgeous. I also love the cut, the collar adds lots of warmth for colder days, and I am so glad there is no hood — you can layer it beneath a raincoat for that snow-to-rain day, and personally I always prefer a hat for better visibility. In short, there is nothing about this coat that isn't perfect.
