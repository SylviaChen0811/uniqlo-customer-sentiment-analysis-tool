DO NOT get your normal or oversized, rather undersize.

Why? -> given it's oversize already, undersizing will guarantee you preserve the oversize look albeit it is more streamline and 'deshabille'. Get your normal size or oversizing will not only render your body and head to appear disproportionate to your clothing, but will intensify the sloppy, garbaggy drape. 

Examples of oversize/garbage baggy: David Bryne during the Talking Heads (1984) 'Stop Making Sense' Tour or the movie Zoolander (1999) Mr. Mugatu's 'Derelict' campaign

Originally, the trench coat was the official uniform during WWI and was worn during  Shackleton's 1914-1917 trans-Antarctica expedition: complete in a double-breasted button-over; D-rings to hold grenades; storm flap guard on the right lapel to protect your pistol; adjustable cuff via straps; in a high-density cotton gabardine fabric. In contrast, this deconstructed, maximinalistic trench coat omits all-aforementioned embellishments yet preserves the back shoulder storm-yoke in a generously oversized silhouette.

For me, I paired this trench coat in natural hue with a wide-brim Panama straw hat then proceeded to wear all black with some Made and Crafted 511's and an Eton Super-Slim, long sleeve button-up with mother-of-pearl buttons - therefore giving a homage to that 60s-70s Parisan, Givenchy chic - taking a saunter down Champs Élysées.",Most FIRE piece of U S/S 2022!,4,6,4.17,1,0,0,1,4,"5'8"" - 5'9""",,,XXS,1,25 to 34 years,Male,,MSGsteve,1647492633,False,False,False

Japan/Asia size is 1 size OFF.. JP/Asia XL = America Large, JP/Asia XXL = America XL.
Wore a base layer shirt, lightweight fleece sweater and a fleece vest while testing the XL size and there Hardly any room to move.
It's winter so you WILL wear something thicker and warm underneath to layer.
Bought the XXL online and it fit well even though it's Oversized. The sleeves extend beyond my wrists and there's NO waist or cinchcord! There may be times some wind will go up the jacket or through the sleeves.
Side hand pockets don't have zipper but are deep and will fit thick gloves and a fleece hat and a smartphone or wallet.
There are No inner zipper pockets except for 1 pocket behind the right hand pocket.
It used to have zippers for its side hand pockets!
It's relatively windproof but it will Not block out the Cold temps when it gets to 32F or below. The fleece is fluffy and big, considering the size. It's relatively difficult to wear underneath a puffy down parka/jacket because of the sheer fluffiness and sizes.
Must pull the long sleeved shirt's and lightweight fleece sweater's sleeves through every time I put on the fluffy jacket.
Overall, it's a good fluffy jacket that does provide some wind protection and should be warmer when temps are at least 40F or more.

Uniqlo needs to really work the following:
1. Sizing issue since it sells its products outside of Japan!
2. Carry XXL sizes at All its stores!
3. Put waist/hood cinchcords and pocket zippers in their jackets!
4. Make more Colorful colors and make LESS clothes with Dark colors like black, blue and grey!!
5. Allow store returns for online purchases like it did ~2 years ago ~2019!!
6. Make clothes priority of Functionality OVER Fashion! Adults also buy Uniqlo clothes not just Skinny, younger people!

134320,E443620-000,23383,4,4,"Sizing issue: Japanese/Asian size is one size Higher than American sizing.
JP/Asian 44-47 XL & 47-50 XXL =/= American 46-48 for XL.
JP/Asian XL = American Large while JP/Asian XXL = American XL 
It's a bigger issue if you're in-between sizes and it also depends on the cut/roominess of the clothing.
If you want it a little tight, buy your regular size.
If you want some room to layer underneath, consider buying 1 size Up!

Bought the XXL, instead of XL, due to Uniqlo's smaller sizing meant for skilly teens/20 somethings instead of adults.
The hoodie fine and obviously more roomy. Would've been better if it was slightly narrower in the body but the XL overall may have been tighter. It's similar to other Uniqlo's Men's sizes for their jackets, made for younger and/or skinny people.
The bigger size does make you look a bit big even when you're not as there's more room in the midsection!
As the hoodie jacket is supposed to be worn in the cold autumn/winter seasons, the XL would've been tight and not enough roomy to layer underneath with a base layer shirt and mid/heavy weight fleece/wool sweater/vest.
The arm length is long, extending out to the base of the thumb. What's not good is that the end opening is a bit wide which will let wind up the arm.
There is no waist cinchcord but appears to be tight enough to keep a seal from unwanted updrafts. The length goes just below the waist.
There are 2 zipper pulls so you can unzip from the bottom to vent as well from the top.
There is one chest zippered pocket which is roomy to hold a thick wallet and smartphone.
There is no inner chest pocket but there is one pocket because of and behind the right hand pocket. The hand pockets don't have zippers but is roomy enough to store gloves and the fabric in front blocks some wind for the hands.
There is hood cinchcord but the hood covers enough of your head and the side of the face but may be tight if you wear a cap. If it gets cold, you can also wear a balaclava or neck gaiter to help keep warm.

Recommend not to wear indoors as you'll sweat.
Worn outside @ 30F with windchill to 25F. Didn't feel the wind but still felt the cold temperature. It blocks some wind but is not warm enough to block out the cold temperature so better to wear as an insulating layer underneath a thicker, insulated (down) jacket when temps drop into the low 30s F and below.

If you are looking for the same thing, THIS is the coat you want. It is much warmer than I expected. I am perfectly cozy wearing this outside with nothing but a t-shirt on underneath when it's sub-freezing. The heat retention is exceptional! Contributing to this warmth, no doubt, is the basically unnoticeable wind-proof layer, and the fact that the whole interior is the exact same fuzzy material as the outside, all the way from the hood to the sleeves. The coat is amazingly soft and fluffy with a relaxed fit. It has a very fresh, contemporary profile that remains ""under the radar."" I really appreciate the cut and versatility of the collar and hood. All of the pockets offer ample storage and are lined with fleece. The design, materials and construction are all A+. I am a skinny 6'4"" guy and bought the XL - glad I did because the length and sleeves of the L may have been a bit too short.

268034,E425974-000,23383,2,4,"There are two big problems I have with these shirts which make them irredeemable. 

The first one is that the fabric is a stretchy nylon material which I wasn't expecting as I ordered it online and it looks like regular cotton in the photo's. I dislike this fabric. It feels cheap and is way too shiny. Overtime the sheen as gone away but it's not comfortable to wear. Feels slippery and scratchy against the skin. Not a fan. This shirt would have been so much better if they just made it out of normal cotton. The fabric choice makes it look cheap. But hey they're inexpensive shirts and that's what you get. 

The second issue I have is that the collar is way too tight and it makes the shirt look awkward because it is meant to be oversized. And I'm a skinny guy with a slim neck. An oversized shirt should not have a tight fitting collar it should be slightly loose. This tight collar has an unflattering appearance on such a big shirt and you can't even stretch it out because the nylon material won't give. That would really just be a band aid anyway. I shouldn't have to stretch the collar out so it fits bigger on OVERSIZED shirt.

It's disappointing because otherwise these shirts would have been great. Unless you're into these aspects that I view as flaws I suggest you look somewhere else for slouchy t-shirts.",Not a fan.,4.5,529,3.44,12,11,12,61,433,"5'8"" - 5'9""",,,M,6,25 to 34 years,Male,California,Downing,1606863088,True,False,False

I ordered a large in this oversized t shirt and it fits great. I would not recommend you size up or down if you know your size in regular Uniqlo t shirts. Obviously, the sleeves are mean to be long and end right before or around the elbow. They do fit loose around the chest and hips, but that's to be expected. They aren't much longer than regular uniqlo t shirts, if at all.

The amazing thing about this shirt is the material. I've never owned a t shirt with this material. The fabric is somewhat thick, much thicker than a normal uniqlo cotton t shirt, but it's somehow cooler to wear. It's really amazing especially for these warmer days. I've tried cotton and polyester mixed shirts before but none like this. You really have to try it on and feel it for yourself. It's got the best qualities of both cotton and polyester without the drawbacks. It doesn't shrink and wrinkle like cotton, but it isn't staticky and flimsy like polyester. It's soft to the skin like cotton, while cool and smooth like polyester.

85409,E422990-000,23383,3,3,"As many reviewers have stated, Uniqlo's Supima T-shirts seem to change every few years, you can tell by the change in SKU#. I bought shirts from this batch (#422990) in mid-December, 2020. The rating I marked (Fair quality) is relative to Uniqlo's past Supima crew neck T-shirts.

This batch of shirts has a larger/looser neck than the older model, as they noted in their description. The fabric is much thinner, comparable to their non-Supima, pre-packaged shirts. It is thin to the point where the shirts are more difficult to fold cleanly, because the thinner fabric makes the shirt seem ""warped"". It's not really warped, thanks to overall build quality, just harder to handle because of how the weaker fabric behaves. I also don't particularly like the wider neck of the current design but this is just a matter of preference.

Keep in mind that I hold the prior batches of the Uniqlo Supima Ts in very high regard. I like that they are thicker, their fit and finish are excellent, and they have held up well to years of washing. A review for those would be marked ""Perfect"" for Quality.

Despite my complaints about the perceived reduction in quality, when compared to cheapie t-shirts at various American retailers that are 1/3 to 1/2 the price, these are still far better and more comfortable. And despite how thin they are, they have held up well to washing so far (3 months), although only time will tell if they last as long as the older versions of this shirt. For those of you who want a cotton shirt with thinner material, this version of the Supima shirt may be for you. For me, I prefer a fabric that is thicker than what this one was.

My ""Yes"" recommendation is conditional: This shirt is better than what many other places offer, but is not as good as the previous versions of the Uniqlo Supima T-shirt. It is recommended for people who like thin fabric. Those who prefer thicker fabric should avoid this.",Reduced quality but better than the competition,4.5,296,3.02,21,19,25,31,200,,,,S,30,,Male,"California, United States",Anonymous,1615765360,False,False,False

I thought I found what I was looking for, so I bought few of them. I gave 3 stars because the quality and feel of the material is great, and they are perfect in the body. Unfortunately the sleeves on the shirts I received are too long and too wide, billowing out on the sides. They look nothing like they did on the model used in the video. I am also more muscular up top and in the arms than the model in the video. If I was as slim as he was, these shirts would look even worse.

First, the fabric is a nice weight and feels high quality. There is a slight sheen to it and feels like it'll last a long time. The cuffs are slightly stiff, which makes it hard to get something like a watch under it, but honestly, I love this because it sits above the wrist really well. Plus, if you have a watch below the cuff, the watch never slides under and stays visible (I like this when the watch needs to help tie the outfit together visually).

It also irons well once air dried, I was surprised. Plus, the heavy fabric means that it doesn't wrinkle easily from sitting. The room in the piece allows you to layer it as well, and have a hoodie or sweater underneath.

Also, the yarn will flatten out almost permanently if exposed to pressure from objects (the elbows area flattened out permanently from just 3 hours of office work).

These pants are slightly baggier than 2021’s Uniqlo U fall/winter wide fit pants, despite having a really similar design. Instead, they’re the same fit as the 2020 corduroys: a little baggier, great side pockets. And these add some great pleats that make them look really sharp beyond just basic baggy pants to wear skating. They look great. If you loved the cords, you’ll love these. 

Olive is the best color, and the pleats are more consistent for some reason on that color. I have the black and they look great too, but for some reason I had to compare probably seven different pairs before I found a pair with consistent pleats (I purchased in-store, all the Olive pairs I saw didn’t have this QC issue). Majority of the black pairs I saw were sewn such that the pleats were hidden by the pockets. Those big pockets on the front look so much better with the pleats visible. Just a heads up if you care about details.

Like other UNIQLO items, this one also passes my quality test - the stichings look really neat and the fabric appears to be very sturdy and high quality.

Fit wise, I'd classify this pair of pants as somewhere between athletic slim-tapered and slim-straight. There's plenty of room around the thigh area but tapers down below the knee. I normally wear a slim-straight and these are perfect. The waistline is however, a little bit high, I compared it against my other pair of chino pants and the bottom of the crouch to the top of the belt loop is about 1-1.5 inches longer on this pant than the other pair from Bonobos. 

Color-wise I got the gray color option but it's much darker than I expected, I'd classify this as a ""heather grey"". It looks good tho so no complaints there.

The pants are relatively warm. You can wear outside when temps go down to the low 30s F or slightly below though you will feel the cold but not as much due to the thin, inner fleece lining. The pants are somewhat form fitting. The fleece lining takes up more room so the pants Should've been designed to be more roomy.
The materials have changed somewhat as well as some other differences, as I have an older pair from 2 yrs ago.
The newer pants have the following changes:
1. Plastic snap button waist instead of the button waist, which is somewhat better; a metal snap button would've been better.
2. The zippers are still YKK though it feels cheaper, not as durable.
3. The nylon has changed. It's a ripstop type of nylon that's been updated. Only time will tell how durable it is.
4. The rear pockets now have velcro instead of buttons. It'll be noisy now using the rear pockets.
5. The additional side pockets..
a) Right side is removed; the right side hand pocket remains.
b) Left side is now made along the seam of the pants; previously, it was perpendicular   below the left side hand pocket
- The hand pockets have a light layer of fleece.
6. The belt buckle has changed. It used to be a regular buckle where you press both sides to release the buckle. Now, you press the middle downward to release the buckle.
7. The belt is still narrowly thin but it's not stretchy as it used to be. Now, it's just nylon webbing, hopefully making it durable.
- You may be able to tailor it to remove the sewn in belt and replace it with a regular nylon belt in the future. But by then, it'll be time for a new pair of pants.
8. The end ankle cinchcord ties have changed. It used to have a plastic stopper where you press the top to adjust the tension. Now, it's some cheap fabric that you slide down to adjust the tension.
9. The rise of the pants are just as Bad as before, from behind. 
- You literally have to keep pulling up the back of the pants since the pants sit Below the waist and the rise is Too Short! You better wear some long tailed shirts as the pants do pull down!!

Some of the updates are good while others are not. Some cost cuttings designs are blatantly obvious for people who used to own the previous version pants.
Overall, it fits relatively well that's more form fitting. It will keep you relatively warm though questionable if worn when temps drop below 30F.

To sum it up, these jeans fit like a Levi’s 502. These pants fit great! If you’re like me, you have a hard time finding jeans that aren’t super wide-legged and baggy. These are it! These still have plenty of thigh room for my large thighs, yet taper enough that they barely scrape my calves. They don’t look skin tight like skinny jeans, yet are slim enough to be flattering. However, if you’re someone who wears jeans below your belly, and therefore probably wear a smaller size, I’d advise against these jeans, as they’ll likely fit like skinny jeans on you.

The stretch is great by the way, they stretch enough to comfortable sit down without having to adjust my jeans beforehand, yet they retain their shape. A problem I’ve had with jeans that have stretch is that they make the jeans feel cheap and thin. This isn’t the case with these jeans, they feel thick and durable while still having a comfortable amount of stretch.

The new ones are closer to Levi 511s (if you size down the waist by one inch for the Uniqlos - I'm 32 in Levis and 31 in this new cut of Uniqlos).

Uniqlo seems to be moving their pant sizes from waist/inseam measurements to small/medium/large. This simplifies their manufacturing process (I assume) and I was willing to give them the benefit of a doubt, but the fit is not good. This might be because I'm between the medium and large sizes. I suppose it fits the way I would expect a ""large"" pair of pants would, which is poorly, though their measurement guidelines suggests that the medium size would be too small for me. (For context, I'm usually a 33 waist, 32 inseam).

I recently bought 2 Large Navy shirts and after washing the first time, the collars were already loose! I don't know if they changed vendors (which seems common for Uniqlo) but these shirts are worse quality than my previous shirts.

227469,E423527-000,23398,4,0,"I've been wanting to try uniqlo's airism cotton fabric for a while now. Found these crewneck tees on sale and gave them a shot.

For reference I am 5'8"", 160lbs, relatively slim build with a mild dad bod / quarantine weight thing going on.

Fit: very solid direct out of the packaging. They are a little long and a little loose. They shrink in the dryer! I am either a small or a medium in most brands' tee shirts, tending towards medium. I bought a medium in these and after shrinking they were quite a bit more 'clingy' than they were before. This has a lot in part to do with a thinner airism fabric relative to a thick cotton, but if you want a larger drapey feel go up a size. 

Fabric: again, it's a thinner fabric and very comparable to uniqlo's alexander wang collaboration shirts they did a few years ago. More 'cotton-y' than other airism, but not as cotton-y as a.. a real cotton shirt. It resists wrinkles after being packed in my suitcase. Good for hot weather, but nothing is magical. It will be better than a thick cotton shirt purely from a perspective of wicking sweat.

Verdict: on sale these are great little shirts for travel. They won't be a staple for my day-to-day, I prefer a thicker 100% cotton pocket tee. However they WILL be a staple for travel during warmer months. The thin / light fabric packs incredibly well and it does good in warm weather.

My only advice is air dry them to avoid the shrinkage.

If anyone at Uniqlo is reading, it's a bummer you don't offer an option with a pocket on the chest. I love pocket tees for travel as it's just helpful to have an extra, non obtrusive pocket on the rare occasion you need to use one.","Shrinks in wash, travels well - great for hot weather",4.5,86,3.02,7,1,2,12,64,"5'8"" - 5'9""",,,M,17,25 to 34 years,Male,"Washington, DC",Alan,1620239903,False,False,False

253302,E423527-000,23398,5,3,"The airism cotton crew neck shirt is the perfect tee shirt for me. 

I have a half dozen regular airism shirts which I tend to use for working out or layering when I want a wicking layer. For that reason, they fit snugly, if not tightly.  Which is perfect for an athletic layer, but not what I want in a tee shirt.

So I was very pleased that the cotton airism shirt fit just a bit more loosely than the standard airism shirt - it's still a trim fit, but it's more tailored and less ""body-hugging"".

I'm very happy with the cotton material - it looks like a crisp medium weight cotton tee. It is very comfortable and breathable, and it seems to be wrinkle free. 

One unexpected advantage of the cotton material is that it seems not to snag (in the same way that regular cotton tends not to snag); my cat performed an unexpected clawing experiment which established this to my satisfaction.

244627,E423535-000,23398,5,3,"I've been wearing the AIRism line of clothing for a while and love how lightweight and comfortable everything is.

These low rise boxer briefs are no exception. It almost feels like they aren't even there. They feel silky smooth and actually luxurious on my skin when compared to cotton or cotton blend underwear. They are also great for slim fit shorts and pants.

The seams are done in such a way that I don't notice them. There isn't any stretching at strange places. They don't ride up or bunch. The elastic if forgiving and doesn't dig in at all. 

One thing I've noticed though, is that they are a bit more revealing in the front than the regular cotton boxer briefs. They show a bit of a contour and make more of an overall ""pouch"" appearance in the front. I do not feel this is negative at all, but want to point out that the material feels different.

They are also fantastic for travel as they can be washed in a hotel room, for instance, as they dry almost instantly.

While Uniqlo allegedly tried to improve their second generation masks, the effort has failed. The material is thinner/lighter which can be be a pro, but the quality control is worse with stray threads hanging about. The masks are also noticeably bigger for the same size compared to the original sizing. But the BIGGEST issue is that the ear loops are TIGHTER, more stressful on the ears, and significantly more comfortable with exposed elastic and Uniqlo not disclosing they removed the cushioning cotton that made the first version so good. This renders the mask almost USELESS if it is uncomfortable to wear and keep on the face. Uniqlo fails to disclose this change and actually markets it as the opposite of what it is - a clear cost cutting measure. They will not offer any demo products and the packaging is opaque so you can’t even tell there is this issue until you open the packaging. And then when you open the packaging, you are out of luck as they won’t accept returns even though you haven’t worn some or all of the masks.

Each time, the process involved a return, which must happen in the same store from where you purchased and, if you ordered online, while you can pick up at a store, you have to get all ""New York"" with a manager before they will do a return in the store.

But you don't make a mask for filtering out breath with a seam down the front! That little detail reduces the effectiveness of the mask by a huge amount. (A filter pocket would have helped!) The other thing that works against this mask is it's knit, which isn't nearly as effective as a tightly woven cotton or silk. SO I cut a flat piece of tight and light cotton and pressed onto its back a matching piece of medium-weight fabric interfacing. Along the inside nose edge of the Airism mask, I sewed a 3/8"" (1 cm) open-ended tube centered and about 1/4"" (7mm) from the nose so that I could insert a piece of bendable aluminum (about 3"" or 7-1/2 cm long) for a custom, tight fit at the nose. Then I zig-zagged the new, lined cotton layer to the top of the Airism mask along all 4 edges, starting from near the ear. As the sewing approached the nose and chin, I made pleats (about 1/4"" or 7mm) and sewed across the pleats. Voila!

Final recommendation: DO NOT BUY

Main reason for a bad review is the sizes stink - I bought all 3 sizes, every size was too lose or too small for my kids (@ 10), my wife, and myself.

What I like: 
The material of the mask is good, the ear loops are a comfortable material, and it is easy to care for & breath through

What Uniqlo can improve on: 
1) make them adjustable
2) make a neck loop so I can quickly take off / on the mask and it sits back. The neck loops you can buy arent great, so having it built in is better
3) nose wire. Seriously this is a requirement, I assumed this had it. My mistake. But bigger mistake they didn't include one
4) the mask fit isn't great. Other masks really form to my face better, I can't describe it, but I didn't like wearing this when I just put it on my face tighter as if they built it properly.

Before the mask came out in the US, I read reviews about how the mask was thick and difficult to breath in, but I saw that they improved the material so I wanted to give it a try.

Sadly, for me, wearing this mask is difficult to breath with and after a short walk I found myself panting. It also fogged my glasses. However, I should also mention that this could be because I have a small face (I am a small petite woman) and I ordered a medium because I saw that small was for children. When I breathe in, the area around the mask near my mouth also comes in so there's the feeling of blowing in a balloon (which is why I think it is difficult for me to breath with mask). The effects of this mask may be different if it fits tight and snug on your face.

Overall, the construction of the mask is good, and the material feels like airism.

These delivered! I've worn them to a couple of small outdoor social-distance gatherings with friends, and they felt comfortable and breathable even after conversing while wearing for a couple of hours. My only complaint, as other reviewers have stated, is the lack of a nose wire. I've got a pretty long nose and high nose bridge, so the lack of wire leaves significant gaps on either side of my nose, and I can feel air flowing in and out of them when I breathe. My DIY solution has just been to glue in spare nose wires leftover from old disposable masks, which isn't ideal but gets the job done. I just hope that moving forward, Uniqlo will add a nose wire to this design. Sizing-wise: I'm a woman with a long nose but small jawline, and I bought a large at first because some reviewers said that folks with larger noses/faces may need to size up.

PROS: It looks great. My son (9) loved his black mask and said it made him look like a ninja. He said it was comfortable. The masks look well made and stylish and the fabric feels great.
CONS: The sizing is waaay off. I read all the reviews and went up a size and even so what we bought was too small. I bought size Small for my 9 year old and it was just barely too small, pulled on the ears. I bought Medium for myself (Asian woman, flat bridge, average face, wears glasses) and it was too small. It was also too shallow so it slid down my nose when I talked, and since it was cut so close to my face, every time I breathed in and out it would stick to my nostrils. It lacks a nose wire so my glasses fogged up. Lastly, and this is a big problem, you can't easily tell which way is up or down, OR which way is inside or out (there is a very small logo on the outside, hard to see).

They are definitely not adjustable - and they’re super small. I took measurements per their measurement guide and the mask pulls on my ears when on. 

They’re breathable BUT that’s because they don’t fit snuggly over the nose, leaving two huge gaps on either side. The whole point of the mask is to a) stop the virus from spreading when you talk and b) to limit the outside air that comes through. Therefore, it does not protect the wearer in any way, shape, or form.

When we leave the hospital we did not know what to do. Loving Airism as I did, I wrote to Uniqlo, asking for a mask that breathes and VOILA! I am so thankful!
The mask is three layered, fits perfectly on the face with good seal for safety. It is comfortable on the ears, nose and chin. If you tuck the top part on the bridge of your nose under your glasses, there is no fogging! This is rare with other masks. 
I wear it for long walks (10 mi). My face stays cool. There is no sweat on my face under the mask. Even as the water vapor comes out of my mouth, it is absorbed in the middle layer so the mask may be wet but the inside and outside layers are always dry and allow air to go trough, keeping my face cool. No rash, no uncomfortable urge to rip the mask off my face (for wearing a mask, that is...) because I cannot breathe. 
The package comes with three masks. I hand wash and dry wringing in a towel after each use. It dries fast so I never run out of masks while I change every time--like we used to change masks before COVID-19 pandemic.

First, I was really surprised that the mask lacked any kind of wire for molding the nose bridge. To try to fix this, I stripped the plastic off of a twist-tie and inserted the remaining wire into the taped seam of the mask. It kind of works, but would be better if it were already constructed with the required wire in it.
Second, I was surprised that the ear loops were too large and not very stretchy, so the mask hung quite loosely off my face. I could have ordered a smaller size, but wanted a longer length so it wouldn't constantly pull down. I knotted each ear loop at the end, which kind of worked: it's a bit tight because there isn't quite enough room for the knotting technique, there's still no stretch in the earloops, but the mask now fits securely.

It's actually more breathable to wear it inside out, i.e., with the logo facing in rather than out.

219285,E437784-000,23407,4,3,"A very good mask for a very good price. This is not some magical cooling mask like the hype that's built around it. It is very breathable, and I was not uncomfortable after wearing it for a couple of hours. The fabric is very soft and the mask overall is VERY lightweight. I am a girl and both the medium and large fit me. The medium was a snug fit while the large felt like it was just resting on my face (It did not slip or fall). I would say men should definitely buy the large. 

This mask is not super different compared to a regular cloth mask or a surgical mask, but it's clear advantage is it's moisture wicking and deodorizing properties. This mask did not smell at all after hours of wear and, while you will still feel the hotness of your breath, the fabric did not seem to soak up any moisture. I do like that the mask has a lot of coverage, covering up to past my eyes when looked at from the side (going towards my ear). This mask will probably be fine for light exercise, but if you are doing an intense workout, you should probably get a mask made for that (Though those can get pricey). There is a supposedly a filter in the middle and it has three layers. The outer layer is not waterproof, but the mask does not absorb water easily (I ran water on it in my sink). 

My breathe did not go through it while breathing, so I think this mask is more than adequate for basic coronavirus prevention and protection. Keep in mind this mask is NOT medical grade. My one complaint for this mask is that the earloops are not stretchy AT ALL. You really need to buy your perfect fit. I find that a small bit of stretch usually helps getting a snugger fit.

Overall, these masks are great if you are just looking for some face masks. They are very well made and a very good price in my opinion. They are not ""super conditioning"" or cooling, but I am not sure there is a mask out there that will feel as comfortable as not wearing one.","Not Magical, but a Great Mask",4,1778,2.66,132,108,142,292,1104,,,,M,3,25 to 34 years,Female,No location given,Penny,1598722285,False,False,False

The pants are relatively warm. You can wear outside when temps go down to the low 30s F or slightly below though you will feel the cold but not as much due to the thin, inner fleece lining. The pants are somewhat form fitting. The fleece lining takes up more room so the pants Should've been designed to be more roomy.
The materials have changed somewhat as well as some other differences, as I have an older pair from 2 yrs ago.
The newer pants have the following changes:
1. Plastic snap button waist instead of the button waist, which is somewhat better; a metal snap button would've been better.
2. The zippers are still YKK though it feels cheaper, not as durable.
3. The nylon has changed. It's a ripstop type of nylon that's been updated. Only time will tell how durable it is.
4. The rear pockets now have velcro instead of buttons. It'll be noisy now using the rear pockets.
5. The additional side pockets..
a) Right side is removed; the right side hand pocket remains.
b) Left side is now made along the seam of the pants; previously, it was perpendicular   below the left side hand pocket
- The hand pockets have a light layer of fleece.
6. The belt buckle has changed. It used to be a regular buckle where you press both sides to release the buckle. Now, you press the middle downward to release the buckle.
7. The belt is still narrowly thin but it's not stretchy as it used to be. Now, it's just nylon webbing, hopefully making it durable.
- You may be able to tailor it to remove the sewn in belt and replace it with a regular nylon belt in the future. But by then, it'll be time for a new pair of pants.
8. The end ankle cinchcord ties have changed. It used to have a plastic stopper where you press the top to adjust the tension. Now, it's some cheap fabric that you slide down to adjust the tension.
9. The rise of the pants are just as Bad as before, from behind. 
- You literally have to keep pulling up the back of the pants since the pants sit Below the waist and the rise is Too Short! You better wear some long tailed shirts as the pants do pull down!!

Some of the updates are good while others are not. Some cost cuttings designs are blatantly obvious for people who used to own the previous version pants.
Overall, it fits relatively well that's more form fitting. It will keep you relatively warm though questionable if worn when temps drop below 30F.

Japan/Asia size is 1 size OFF.. JP/Asia XL = America Large, JP/Asia XXL = America XL.
Wore a base layer shirt, lightweight fleece sweater and a fleece vest while testing the XL size and there Hardly any room to move.
It's winter so you WILL wear something thicker and warm underneath to layer.
Bought the XXL online and it fit well even though it's Oversized. The sleeves extend beyond my wrists and there's NO waist or cinchcord! There may be times some wind will go up the jacket or through the sleeves.
Side hand pockets don't have zipper but are deep and will fit thick gloves and a fleece hat and a smartphone or wallet.
There are No inner zipper pockets except for 1 pocket behind the right hand pocket.
It used to have zippers for its side hand pockets!
It's relatively windproof but it will Not block out the Cold temps when it gets to 32F or below. The fleece is fluffy and big, considering the size. It's relatively difficult to wear underneath a puffy down parka/jacket because of the sheer fluffiness and sizes.
Must pull the long sleeved shirt's and lightweight fleece sweater's sleeves through every time I put on the fluffy jacket.
Overall, it's a good fluffy jacket that does provide some wind protection and should be warmer when temps are at least 40F or more.

Uniqlo needs to really work the following:
1. Sizing issue since it sells its products outside of Japan!
2. Carry XXL sizes at All its stores!
3. Put waist/hood cinchcords and pocket zippers in their jackets!
4. Make more Colorful colors and make LESS clothes with Dark colors like black, blue and grey!!
5. Allow store returns for online purchases like it did ~2 years ago ~2019!!
6. Make clothes priority of Functionality OVER Fashion! Adults also buy Uniqlo clothes not just Skinny, younger people!

JP/Asian 44-47 XL & 47-50 XXL =/= American 46-48 for XL.
JP/Asian XL = American Large while JP/Asian XXL = American XL 
It's a bigger issue if you're in-between sizes and it also depends on the cut/roominess of the clothing.
If you want it a little tight, buy your regular size.
If you want some room to layer underneath, consider buying 1 size Up!

Bought the XXL, instead of XL, due to Uniqlo's smaller sizing meant for skilly teens/20 somethings instead of adults.
The hoodie fine and obviously more roomy. Would've been better if it was slightly narrower in the body but the XL overall may have been tighter. It's similar to other Uniqlo's Men's sizes for their jackets, made for younger and/or skinny people.
The bigger size does make you look a bit big even when you're not as there's more room in the midsection!
As the hoodie jacket is supposed to be worn in the cold autumn/winter seasons, the XL would've been tight and not enough roomy to layer underneath with a base layer shirt and mid/heavy weight fleece/wool sweater/vest.
The arm length is long, extending out to the base of the thumb. What's not good is that the end opening is a bit wide which will let wind up the arm.
There is no waist cinchcord but appears to be tight enough to keep a seal from unwanted updrafts. The length goes just below the waist.
There are 2 zipper pulls so you can unzip from the bottom to vent as well from the top.
There is one chest zippered pocket which is roomy to hold a thick wallet and smartphone.
There is no inner chest pocket but there is one pocket because of and behind the right hand pocket. The hand pockets don't have zippers but is roomy enough to store gloves and the fabric in front blocks some wind for the hands.
There is hood cinchcord but the hood covers enough of your head and the side of the face but may be tight if you wear a cap. If it gets cold, you can also wear a balaclava or neck gaiter to help keep warm.

Recommend not to wear indoors as you'll sweat.
Worn outside @ 30F with windchill to 25F. Didn't feel the wind but still felt the cold temperature. It blocks some wind but is not warm enough to block out the cold temperature so better to wear as an insulating layer underneath a thicker, insulated (down) jacket when temps drop into the low 30s F and below.
